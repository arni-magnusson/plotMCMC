\title{MCMC Results for Recruitment}
\description{
  Markov chain Monte Carlo results from stock assessment of cod
  (\emph{Gadus morhua}) in Icelandic waters, showing estimated
  recruitment by year.
}
\usage{xrec}
\format{
  Data frame containing 1000 rows and 33 columns (years 1970 to 2002).
}
\details{
  Each column contains the results of 1 million MCMC iterations, after
  thinning to every 1000th iteration.

  The MCMC analysis started at the best fit, so no burn-in period was
  discarded.
}
\note{
  Recruitment is the size of a cohort (year class), in this case
  thousands of one-year-olds.

  For example, \code{xrec$"1980"} is the estimated number of
  one-year-olds in 1981, the cohort that hatched in 1980.

  This data frame is a subset of the \code{\link[scape]{xmcmc}} list
  from the \pkg{scape} package, which contains further documentation
  about the data and model. More specifically, \code{xrec <- xmcmc$R}.

  The MCMC analysis was run using the \dfn{AD Model Builder} software
  (\url{http://admb-project.org}).
