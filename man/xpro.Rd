\title{MCMC Results for Future Projections}
\description{
  Markov chain Monte Carlo results from stock assessment of cod
  (\emph{Gadus morhua}) in Icelandic waters, showing future projected
  biomass in tonnes.
}
\usage{xpro}
\format{
  Data frame containing 1000 rows and 4 columns (years 2004 to 2007).
}
\details{
  Each column contains the results of 1 million MCMC iterations, after
  thinning to every 1000th iteration.

  The MCMC analysis started at the best fit, so no burn-in period was
  discarded.
}
\note{
  The projections are based on a fixed harvest rate, where 25\% of the
  biomass (ages 4 and older) is caught every year.

  This data frame is a subset of the \code{xproj} list from the
  \pkg{scape} package, which contains further documentation about the
  data and model. Specifically, \code{xpro <- xproj$"0.25"}.

  The MCMC analysis was run using the \dfn{AD Model Builder} software
  (\url{https://www.admb-project.org}).
